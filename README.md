## 🌟 Key Features

### 🎈 Event Planning Assistant  
Plan parties, weddings, get-togethers, kitty parties, travel itineraries, and more. YOJO helps generate a fully personalized checklist of items needed for the event — based on event type, age group, preferences, and budget.

### 🛍 Product Recommendations with Real Prices & Links  
YOJO recommends actual products from online stores (e.g., Amazon, Flipkart) with:
- Live shopping URLs  
- Updated pricing  
- Product categories (decorations, snacks, accessories, etc.)

### 🎯 Budget-Aware Planning  
Input your budget and let YOJO dynamically adjust its recommendations. It filters and suggests products that best fit within your budget constraints.

### 🧠 Context-Aware Conversation  
YOJO remembers what items the user already owns (e.g., "I already have balloons and return gifts") and avoids adding them to the final shopping list — making planning smarter and more efficient.

### 📦 Multi-Category Assistant Modules  
YOJO supports multiple categories and use cases:
- *🎉 Events:* Birthday parties, weddings, kitty parties, anniversaries  
- *✈ Travel:* Packing checklists, essentials, travel-sized products  
- *📷 Media:* Suggestions for photography/videography services and decor  
- *🛒 Shopping:* Real-time product suggestions with buying links
